# Intro

Hello, and welcome to my Joule guide. This guide is meant to be a definitive resource for playing Joule that encompasses anything and everything you might want to know about playing her. I will go over her kit in depth, higher level game plans, combos, builds, powers, and team comps.

This guide is good as a starting point for new Joule players but will likely contain information useful to people of any experience level.

## Who is Joule?

Joule plays like a burst mage that excels at disrupting backlines and applying relentless pressure. Her high survivability makes her great as a solo-carry that can clean up lobbies with her diverse toolkit, but she also plays well in front-to-back style comps with a more structured play style.
## Joule pros:

- High damage
- High mobility
- High survivability
- Solid crowd control (CC) options
- 1v9 potential
## Joule cons:

- Highly telegraphed
- Hunters that counter her (Oath, Brall, Jin, Bishop) are strong and popular
- High-ish execution barrier
- Somewhat buggy in her current state

This guide is written as of January 2025, season 0 of the open beta.

Disclaimer: this guide contains a mix of factual knowledge as well as information gathered from my own experience playing and watching Joule. I am not the official Joule expert and there will likely parts of this guide you don't fully agree with. That's ok, I just love this game and I love playing Joule, and this guide came to be from a passion for my desire to learn and improve at the game.

# Kit overview

## Passive

Joule's passive is a stacking system. Damaging an enemy with Joule's abilities or primary fire will mark them with a stack, up to a maximum of 4.

If an enemy is not damaged by Joule for [] Seconds, they will lose all their stacks.

## Shift

Joule's Shift lets her dash in a direction, dealing a small amount of damage to enemies hit. Joule can hold the Shift key before releasing to charge it, increasing its travel distance.

If Joule hits an enemy with her Shift while they are fully stacked by her passive, she consumes the stacks, deals a massive amount of bonus damage, and resets the cooldown of her Shift.

Joule's Shift and passive together make up the core gameplay loop of Joule: applying and consuming stacks to deal lots of damage while using her resets to position. The rest of her kit are tools to supplement this idea.

Her Shift has a unique hitbox. Joule's Shift can feel awkward to land on enemies at first but once you understand how the hitbox is formed you will land it much more consistently. A later section of this guide is dedicated to the Shift hitbox and its aiming properties.

## LMB

Joule's primary fire is a medium-long range bolt. It has relatively low damage, but is her main way of applying stacks to enemies.

Joule's primary has piercing properties, that is, it doesn't stop on the first target it hits, so stacking multiple enemies at a time is possible. 

At medium-to-long range and in early-game skirmishes, she can use her primary to slow-chase and non-commitally threaten engages that can force enemies to reposition or risk getting bursted.

The low startup time of the primary fire's animation combined with her crowd control makes it possible to weave unmissable shots between her spells and stack enemies extremely quickly, a technique that vastly decreases her time-to-kill and the potency of her punish game.

## RMB

Joule's RMB is a chargeable projectile that fires a spear of lightning, dealing damage and knocking targets back. Enemies that are knocked into a wall get stunned. Projectile range, damage, and stun duration increase with charge time.  While charging Joule gets a minor self-slow.

If Joule hits an enemy hunter with her RMB, it spawns an orb at the point of impact. The orb is spawned with a small upwards velocity, but is affected by gravity and will drop onto the ground (or into the abyss).

If Joule makes contact with the orb, the orb is consumed and the cooldown of Joule's Shift is reset. If Joule's Shift is not on cooldown, it will still consume the orb and the effect is wasted.

Joule's combo game revolves around her RMB as it sets up a guaranteed spell rotation in many situations. RMB is amazing as a CC layer to follow up Joule's Q, a glider stun, or an ally's CC. The knock-back on RMB is surprisingly high and it cancels dashes, making it very good at snuffing engaging melees. The orb reset is really what gives RMB most of its value, and is what enables Joule's exceptional mobility in fights.

This ability is a Swiss-Army Knife, giving Joule damage, lockdown, self-peel, and mobility. Understanding the different utilities that this ability provides allows Joule to play more multidimensionally, and gives you many more options at your disposal in many different scenarios.

## Q

Joule's Q is an AOE that pops after a short delay, damaging targets and pushing them in a direction of Joule's choosing. If no direction is specified, they will be pushed towards Joule. While being pushed, enemies are grounded.

Joule's Q is similar to her RMB in that they both can be used to peel and lockdown targets. Q has lower reward on hit than RMB but in exchange has better range and affects an area. An enemy hit by Joule's Q is often able to get hit by her RMB as a follow up.

Joule's Q is very good for controlling space. By placing it strategically in skirmishes, Joule can limit her opponents movement options and cut off escape paths.

The threat of Q can punish enemies for contesting wisps, boxes, and beacons. This concept is especially powerful from fog-of-war. Sneaking out of a fight and using Q from fog to catch an enemy standing on their ally's wisp is one of Joule's bread and butter skirmish tactics. The same idea applies not just to resurrections but also enemies capturing base camps, opening chests or supply drops, or any other situation that forces them to stand still for a time.

Joule can push orbs from her RMB around with her q. She can also push enemy Joule's orbs around, which steals them and allows her to pick them up.

## Ult

Joule's Ult is her piece de resistance. After a short startup window, Joule flies into the air and remains there, invulnerable, until she recasts at a target location within range, causing her to slam down in an aoe that damages and knocks back enemies hit.

Joule can vary the amount of time she waits before recasting to bait out enemies trying to dodge the impact. She can also use the invulnerability window to stall for her cooldowns mid fight.

She can use her Ult to cross over any terrain, but the recast location must be on the ground, so she cannot Ult directly onto the abyss.

If Joule is stunned, knocked back, or grounded during the startup window before the invlunerablity starts, the ulti is cancelled and put on cooldown.

The most unique part of Joule's Ult is how it interacts with her passive. If Joule strikes a target with the impact, it applies 1 stack to that target, and then takes however many stacks that target now has, and applies the same number of stacks to every enemy hunter inside the ult's cast range. For example, if you get an enemy up to 3 stacks and then Ult them, upon hitting them with your ult, they and all of their allies nearby will immediately be put at full stacks, even though their allies had no stacks to begin with.

That pretty much describes Joule's ideal front-to-back teamfight scenario: slow chase the enemy frontliner until they get 3 stacks, Ult them to fully stack the entire enemy team, and then Shift around, resetting and nuking everyone.

When it comes to the stack-spreading mechanic of Joule's ult, its important to note that the area in which it spreads stacks is the intial ulti cast range, and is not affected by Joule's destination location. To put it simply, enemies will only have stacks spread to them if they are inside the circle. This means, sometimes its better to Shift onto someone and then Ult when youre on top of them, rather than use your Ult as a gapcloser. Doing so might set you up to spread stacks more effectively to the rest of their team, depending on how theyre positioned.

Having Ult available allows Joule to play extremely aggressively. It gives her a get-out-of-jail-free card that adds another layer of survivability to her already very mobile kit.

...As a final note, something you should know about Joule's Ult is that, at the time of producing this guide, it is very buggy. Sometimes, it gets cancelled but it doesnt look like it got cancelled, and sometimes it doesnt get cancelled but looks like it did. Sometimes, it doesnt spread stacks properly or evenly to all targets, this seems to happen more often when hitting multiple enemies directly with the recast.

# Shift hitbox

Shifts hitbox has two sections, the stick and the lollipop. The stick is drawn from Joule's origin point to her destination point, and is a very thin line. The lollipop creates a much bigger circular hitbox at Joule's destination location.

The stick is extremely thin and difficult to land against moving targets, so against enemies that are not CC'd, your goal should always be to hit them with the lollipop hitbox.

Now, with this idea in mind, it's important to consider the nature of Joule's Shift when it comes to its travel distance. Because Joule can charge her Shift to extend the distance, that means charging her Shift allows her to control where the lollipop hitbox gets placed. However, Joule's Shift has a minimum travel distance, meaning even if you only tap the Shift key for the smallest possible amount of time, she will still travel that minimum distance.

Put all of these concepts together, and effectively you can imagine that Joule has a "dead-zone" that surrounds her where, if enemies are inside her minimum Shift travel distance, it's not possible to hit them with the lollipop, and therefore makes it risky to try and hit them with Shift.

This suits Joule's "ebb-and-flow" fighting style, where you play aggressively to start building stacks, and then create a bit of space to get out of that deadzone as the enemy becomes fully stacked. Then, you immediately strike with Shift at its minimum distance, hitting them with the lollipop.

Hitting enemies with the stick is possible of course, just more difficult, but can easily be done from RMB's knock-back or stun, or, more situationally, a knock-back or ground from Q.

## Shift bending

Joule's Shift cannot travel through terrain, so colliding with a wall during the dash will affect its trajectory. If the angle of the wall is shallow enough to the dashing direction, she will slide along the boundary of the terrain while attempting to return to the original dashing trajectory. This allows Joule to bend and curve her shift along and around obstacles.
