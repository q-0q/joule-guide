# Intro

Hello, and welcome to my Joule guide. This guide is meant to be a definitive resource for playing Joule that encompasses anything and everything you might want to know about playing her. I will go over her kit in depth, higher level game plans, combos, builds, powers, and team comps.

This guide is good as a starting point for new Joule players but will likely contain information useful to people of any experience level.

Disclaimer: this guide contains a mix of factual knowledge as well as information gathered from my own experience playing and watching Joule. I am not the official Joule expert and there will likely parts of this guide you don't fully agree with. That's ok, I just love this game and I love playing Joule, and this guide came to be from a passion for my desire to learn and improve at the game.

## Who is Joule?

Joule plays like a burst mage that excels at disrupting backlines and applying strong pressure. Her high survivability makes her great as a solo-carry that can clean up lobbies with her diverse toolkit, but she also plays well in front-to-back style comps with a more structured play style.
## Joule pros:

- High damage
- High mobility
- High survivability
- Solid crowd control (CC) options
- 1v9 potential
## Joule cons:

- Highly telegraphed
- Hunters that counter her (Oath, Brall, Jin, Bishop) are strong and popular
- High-ish execution barrier
- Somewhat buggy in her current state

This guide is written as of Season 0 of the Open Beta.

# Kit overview

## Passive

Joule's passive is a stacking system. Damaging an enemy with Joule's abilities or primary fire will mark them with a stack, up to a maximum of 4.

If an enemy is not damaged by Joule for [] Seconds, they will lose all their stacks.

## Shift

Joule's Shift lets her dash in a direction, dealing a small amount of damage to enemies hit. Joule can hold the Shift key before releasing to charge it, increasing its travel distance, while dashing Joule is briefly invulnerable.

If Joule hits an enemy with her Shift while they are fully stacked by her passive, she consumes the stacks, deals a massive amount of bonus damage, and resets the cooldown of her Shift.

Joule's Shift and passive together make up the core gameplay loop of Joule: applying and consuming stacks to deal lots of damage while using her resets to position. The rest of her kit are tools to supplement this idea.

Her Shift has a unique hitbox. Joule's Shift can feel awkward to land on enemies at first but once you understand how the hitbox is formed you will land it much more consistently. A later section of this guide is dedicated to the Shift hitbox and its aiming properties.

## LMB

Joule's primary fire is a medium-long range bolt. It has relatively low damage, but is her main way of applying stacks to enemies.

Joule's primary has piercing properties, that is, it doesn't stop on the first target it hits, so stacking multiple enemies at a time is possible. 

At medium-to-long range and in early-game skirmishes, she can use her primary to slow-chase and non-commitally threaten engages that can force enemies to reposition or risk getting bursted.

The low startup time of the primary fire's animation combined with her crowd control makes it possible to weave unmissable shots between her spells and stack enemies extremely quickly, a technique that vastly decreases her time-to-kill and the potency of her punish game.

## RMB

Joule's RMB is a chargeable projectile that fires a spear of lightning, dealing damage and knocking targets back. Enemies that are knocked into a wall get stunned. Projectile range, damage, and stun duration increase with charge time.  While charging Joule gets a minor self-slow.

If Joule hits an enemy hunter with her RMB, it spawns an orb at the point of impact. The orb is spawned with a small upwards velocity, but is affected by gravity and will drop onto the ground (or into the abyss).

If Joule makes contact with the orb, the orb is consumed and the cooldown of Joule's Shift is reset. If Joule's Shift is not on cooldown, it will still consume the orb and the effect is wasted.

Joule's combo game revolves around her RMB as it sets up a guaranteed spell rotation in many situations. RMB is amazing as a CC layer to follow up Joule's Q, a glider stun, or an ally's CC. The knock-back on RMB is surprisingly high and it cancels dashes, making it very good at snuffing engaging melees. The orb reset is really what gives RMB most of its value, and is what enables Joule's exceptional mobility in fights.

This ability is a Swiss-Army Knife, giving Joule damage, lockdown, self-peel, and mobility. Understanding the different utilities that this ability provides allows Joule to play more multidimensionally, and gives you many more options at your disposal in many different scenarios.

## Q

Joule's Q is an AOE that pops after a short delay, damaging targets and pushing them in a direction of Joule's choosing. If no direction is specified, they will be pushed towards Joule. While being pushed, enemies are grounded.

Joule's Q is similar to her RMB in that they both can be used to peel and lockdown targets. Q has lower reward on hit than RMB but in exchange has better range and affects an area. An enemy hit by Joule's Q is often able to get hit by her RMB as a follow up.

Joule's Q is very good for controlling space. By placing it strategically in skirmishes, Joule can limit her opponents movement options and cut off escape paths.

The threat of Q can punish enemies for contesting wisps, boxes, and beacons. This concept is especially powerful from fog-of-war. Sneaking out of a fight and using Q from fog to catch an enemy standing on their ally's wisp is one of Joule's bread and butter skirmish tactics. The same idea applies not just to resurrections but also enemies capturing base camps, opening chests or supply drops, or any other situation that forces them to stand still for a time.

Joule can push orbs from her RMB around with her q. She can also push enemy Joule's orbs around, which steals them and allows her to pick them up.

## Ult

Joule's Ult is her piece de resistance. After a short startup window, Joule flies into the air and remains there, invulnerable, until she recasts at a target location within range, causing her to slam down in an aoe that damages and knocks back enemies hit.

Joule can vary the amount of time she waits before recasting to bait out enemies trying to dodge the impact. She can also use the invulnerability window to stall for her cooldowns mid fight.

She can use her Ult to cross over any terrain, but the recast location must be on the ground, so she cannot Ult directly onto the abyss.

If Joule is stunned, knocked back, or grounded during the startup window before the invlunerablity starts, the ulti is cancelled and put on cooldown.

The most unique part of Joule's Ult is how it interacts with her passive. If Joule strikes a target with the impact, it applies 1 stack to that target, and then takes however many stacks that target now has, and applies the same number of stacks to every enemy hunter inside the ult's cast range. For example, if you get an enemy up to 3 stacks and then Ult them, upon hitting them with your ult, they and all of their allies nearby will immediately be put at full stacks, even though their allies had no stacks to begin with.

That pretty much describes Joule's ideal front-to-back teamfight scenario: slow chase the enemy frontliner until they get 3 stacks, Ult them to fully stack the entire enemy team, and then Shift around, resetting and nuking everyone.

When it comes to the stack-spreading mechanic of Joule's ult, its important to note that the area in which it spreads stacks is the intial ulti cast range, and is not affected by Joule's destination location. To put it simply, enemies will only have stacks spread to them if they are inside the circle. This means, sometimes its better to Shift onto someone and then Ult when youre on top of them, rather than use your Ult as a gapcloser. Doing so might set you up to spread stacks more effectively to the rest of their team, depending on how theyre positioned.

Having Ult available allows Joule to play extremely aggressively. It gives her a get-out-of-jail-free card that adds another layer of survivability to her already very mobile kit.

...As a final note, something you should know about Joule's ult is that, at the time of producing this guide, it is very buggy. Sometimes, it gets cancelled but it doesn't look like it got cancelled, and sometimes it doesn't get cancelled but looks like it did. Sometimes, it doesn't spread stacks properly or evenly to all targets, this seems to happen more often when hitting multiple enemies directly with the recast.

# Shift deep lore

## The lollipop

Shifts hitbox has two sections, the stick and the lollipop. The stick is drawn from Joule's origin point to her destination point, and is a very thin line. The lollipop creates a much bigger circular hitbox at Joule's destination location.

The stick is pretty thin and can be difficult to land against moving targets, so against enemies that are not CC'd, your goal should be to hit them with the lollipop hitbox.

Now, with this idea in mind, it's important to consider the nature of Joule's Shift when it comes to its travel distance. Because Joule can charge her Shift to extend the distance, that means charging her Shift allows her to control where the lollipop hitbox gets placed. However, Joule's Shift has a minimum travel distance, meaning even if you only tap the Shift key for the smallest possible amount of time, she will still travel that minimum distance.

Put all of these concepts together, and effectively you can imagine that Joule has a "dead-zone" that surrounds her where, if enemies are inside her minimum Shift travel distance, it's not possible to hit them with the lollipop, and therefore makes it risky to try and hit them with Shift.

This suits Joule's "ebb-and-flow" fighting style, where you play aggressively to start building stacks, and then create a bit of space to get out of that deadzone as the enemy becomes fully stacked. Then, you immediately strike with Shift at its minimum distance, hitting them with the lollipop.

The circular shape not only makes it easier to land on enemies moving laterally, but can be used to extend the range of the dash, wrap the hitbox around small corners, hit multiple targets, and other micro-spacing related tricks that you will eventually pick up on once you start getting experience with placing it in fights.

None of this is to say you should never try and hit people with the stick, however. From any CC such as RMB's knock-back or stun, Q, or any ally CC, hitting them with the stick is fine and often allow your Shift to come out faster as you don't waste time readjusting your position. I just recommend that, when first learning to play Joule, you try and focus on hitting people with the lollipop as it will force you to be more cognizant of its properties while also being generally more forgiving. Once you get more experience with the ability, you will start to know when to use the stick and when to use the lollipop.

Finally, something I didn't say yet is that Shift actually has a third hitbox, a short-lived circular AOE hitbox that is created at Joule's starting point when she releases the Shift key and starts dashing. This hitbox is smaller than her lollipop and really exists mainly as a quality-of-life feature to make it easier to hit enemies directly on top of her. It's small size makes it somewhat niche, but you should be aware that this hitbox exists, and know that in situations where you can take advantage of it, it is very useful.

## Shift bending

Joule's Shift cannot travel through terrain, so colliding with a wall during the dash will affect its trajectory. If the angle of the wall is shallow enough to the dashing direction, she will slide along the boundary of the terrain, which will readjust the direction of the dash. This allows Joule to bend and curve her shift along and around obstacles.

## Shift charging tech

If Joule is airborne when she starts charging, she will remain airborne and retain any horizontal velocity she had when she started charging. This means if Joule starts channeling shift while jumping through the air, she will slide. It's a subtle amount of movement, but it technically can be used to extend the range of your dash, or to dodge attacks while charging. If Joule can get more horizontal momentum from a different source like a Zeph Shift or a fan, she can slide much further.

Additionally, Joule's vertical velocity is zeroed out while charging and dashing. You can shift while extremely low in the abyss to make escapes that are hard for a lot of characters to contest.
 
Joule can freely rotate her field of view, and subsequently her character model, while charging. This means she can charge her shift for a duration, but change her dash direction at the last moment. This has no tangible effect but it can be used as a mind-game or to catch people off guard and make it harder for them to react to the Shift. This is especially powerful when you have multiple enemy hunters stacked at once and you fake out which of them you go for.

Combining this with the jump-charge-slide can really throw people off, especially against better players that are conditioned to be very cautious of Shift.

## Non-hunter resets

Any non-hunter unit that can receive stacks from Joule's passive can be used as a free reset, either in fights or when just moving around the map. A common tactic early-game fights is to fully stack a nearby camp, and then position yourself in melee range of the camp such that you can perform a fully charged dash through the camp and into an aggressive position that can catch enemies off guard.

Also, if you don't already know, staggering a camp or boss when they have the pink indicator will reset the cooldown of the ability used to stagger them, which can be used to Joule's advantage in the same way that fully stacking a camp would. Just be careful someone doesn't proc the stagger before you do.

You can perform the same action on an RMB orb if one happens to be nearby.

This concept applies to camps, bosses, soul crystals, and even BeeBombs.

## Shift execution & holding stacks

The nature of Joule's kit could be described as "backloaded", in that she first must set up her damage and then later act on her setup to deal damage, which starts the process over again.

From the enemy's point of view, this means Joule starts in a low-threat state, and only becomes threatening once she builds her stacks. However, even if she can successfully consume her stacks with empowered Shift, if the enemy is not killed, despite them likely being very low on health, Joule has now returned to her lower-threat state, forcing her to win another interaction against the enemy to actually kill them.

Let's consider two simple Level 1 scenarios.

Scenario 1: Joule hits enemy Ghost with 4 LMBs, dealing 15% of his health. She procs passive on him with Shift, dealing 70% of his health. She then hits him with 4 more LMBs to deal the remaining 15% health and kills him.

Scenario 2: Joule hits enemy Ghost with 4 LMBs, dealing 15% of his health. Instead of immediately Shifting, she continues to pressure with LMB. Ghost is trying to avoid the empowered Shift, so his DPS against you is lowered and he isn't moving in a way to avoid your LMBs. You land 4 more LMBs to deal another 15%, and then Shift on him to deal the remaining 70%, killing him.

Hopefully you observe that in scenario 2, Ghost had fewer options to counter-play Joule, and Joule had more options. The amount of LMBs and Shifts that she needs to land in both scenarios is the same, but by saving Shift to execute Ghost, she never is put into a situation where she needs to fight without the threat of Shift or in close-quarters, vastly reducing her risk of engagement. It also allows her to wait until the very end to decide whether she wants to commit to using Shift at all, which can save her from accidentally committing to a bad fight.

By keeping the enemy fully stacked and continuing to pressure with LMB, Joule can hold the tension of the skirmish and control the fight on her terms. Being fully stacked puts a heavy mental load on enemy players, giving Joule easy ways to get away with extra DPS and punish obvious mistakes. It also gives her more meaningful mobility options, as she can save her stacked reset for dodging a specific ability or countering an engage, rather than dashing just for the sake of dealing damage.

When you have multiple enemy hunters fully stacked at once (most commonly after ulting a stacked target), you will have a very strong urge to dash around in rapid succession with multiple resets. It looks cool and it feels good to do, but often, for all the reasons mentioned previously, you could get more value if you focus one target at a time, consuming the stacks only to kill each target or to reposition at key moments.

I believe there is a lot of room for micro-optimization when it comes to holding stacks on Joule. Experiment with it in your gameplay to find how it fits into your playstyle.




## Undercasting

this should go in or after combos section

after explaining LMB weaving on RMB, mention that specifically when the enemy is at 2 stacks and hitting the RMB puts them at 3, it can be better to not weave so that you dont put enemy at full stacks; its better to shift in to put them at full then shift out and proc -- leads to much better positioning after reset

in other words, u never want to shift thru orb and also proc passive with a single shift
